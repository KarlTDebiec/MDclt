The Molecular Dynamics Analysis Toolkit is a set of functions intended to simplify analysis of molecular dynamics
trajectories. MDAT aims to automate (i.e. hide) tedious steps of analysis such as looping over multiple files, storing
the results in a database, and splitting calculation across multiple cores. MDAT makes use of external libraries
including h5py, MDAnalysis, and Cython; use of the Enthought Python Distribution is recommended. Analyses are split
into primary (of trajectories and associated logs) and secondary (of primary analyses). The corresponding functions
are analyze_primary and analyze_secondary, and they are probably best explained by example:

    from analysis_toolkit import analyze_primary

    analyze_primary(
        n_cores         = 8,
        hdf5_filename   = "/home/ubiquitin.hdf5",
        path            = "/home/13-01_01_ubiquitin",
        segment_lister  = "standard_functions.segments_standard",
        analyses        = [("anton.energy",   {}),
                           ("general.rmsd",   {"domain":      "ubiquitin",
                                               "selection":   "protein and name CA and resid 3:71",
                                               "reference":   "/home/ubiquitin.pdb"})])

This function call will look at the the trajectory at "/home/13-01_01_ubiquitin" and use the function
"standard_functions.segments_standard" to list the trajectory segments present. It will conduct two analyses, the
function "energy" in the module "amber" and the function "rmsd" in the module "general". The first function parses
Amber's energy log, while the second calculates the RMSD relative to a template. It will first check 
"/home/ubiqutin.hdf5" to see what analyses have been previously completed, and generate a task list for those that
remain. Those tasks will be split across 8 cores, and the results stored in "/home/ubiquitin.hdf5"

    from analysis_toolkit import analyze_secondary

    analyze_secondary(
        n_cores         = 8,
        hdf5_filename   = "/home/ubiquitin.hdf5",
        analyses        = [("rotation.diffusion_tensor",    {"domain":      "ubiquitin",
                                                             "n_vectors":   1000,
                                                             "tau_finite":  np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]),
                                                             "verbose":     True})])

This function call will apply the secondary analysis function "diffusion_tensor" from the module "rotation" to the
primary data stored in "/home/ubiquitin.hdf5". The parameters "domain", "n_vectors", "tau_finite", and "verbose" are
passed to the function, and the results stored in "/home/ubiqutin.hdf5"

The program presently requires data to be organized as <SEGMENT_#>/<SEGMENT_#>.*, thought this is intended to be
easily modified by writing an alternative segment_lister function.
